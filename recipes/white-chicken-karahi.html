    <h2>Ingredients</h2>    

        <ul>
            <li>Chicken (Bone/Boneless)</li>
            <li>Spices (mainly black pepper, roasted cumin and roasted coriander)</li>
            <li>Onion paste</li>
            <li>Cream and Yogurt</li>
            <li>Ginger garlic paste</li>
            <li>Ginger and green chilli</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Dry roast coriander, cumin, and black pepper in a pan. (Protip: Consider switching black pepper with white pepper if you want whiter color. )</li>
            <li>Then grind into a powder.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a wok and add chicken pieces. Fry for 2 minutes on high heat until pinkish hue vanishes.</li>
            <li>With the heat still on high, add ginger garlic paste, chili paste and onion paste. Keep stirring. (Protip: If using fresh ginger, garlic and chilies, ground all three and onion together into a paste, add a little water if needed to pulse.)</li>
            <li>Add grounded spices of step 1. (You can see the grounded spices are neither very coarse nor very fine). Also add garam masala if using. (Whole spice powder is optional, because it darken the color of karahi.)</li>
            <li>Cook for 5 minutes on high heat stirring until onion water gets dry and onions have softened. Add yogurt, cover and cook for 10-15 minutes until chicken is tender and yogurt water dries and desired consistency is reached.</li>
            <li>The chicken is tender and a layer of oil has separated on top. Add cream and cook for 2 minutes. Avoid too much cooking on high heat after adding cream.</li>
            <li>When a layer of oil separates on the top your white Karahi is ready. Cut medium green chili into halves and remove seeds. Add half of it in white karahi for aroma and save the remaining half for garnish.</li>
        </ol>
    
        <p>Garnish white chicken karahi with remaining chili halves and shredded ginger. Serve with nan, chapati, or roti.</p>
